# Project Proposal: MediaVersion Pro

## 1. Executive Summary

**MediaVersion Pro** is an innovative WordPress plugin designed to address a critical gap in media management: granular version control for media files. While existing backup and media organization plugins provide full-site snapshots or file organization, none offer detailed tracking of individual media changes, with the ability to revert to previous versions seamlessly. MediaVersion Pro will empower WordPress users—especially those running content-heavy sites—to maintain precise control over images, videos, and other media assets. Its unique multisite synchronization and cloud storage integration further enhance its appeal for large organizations and multisite networks.

## 2. Problem Statement

Many WordPress users face significant challenges in managing media files, particularly on sites that frequently update their visuals:
- **Frequent Media Updates:** E-commerce platforms, news outlets, and creative portfolios often need to update product images, banners, or multimedia content. Current backup tools capture whole-site snapshots, making it cumbersome to restore a single file.
- **Lack of Granular Versioning:** While some plugins help organize media (e.g., Real Media Library), they do not track every change or offer the ability to revert individual media files.
- **Multisite Complexity:** Administrators managing multisite networks struggle to maintain consistent media file version histories across various sites, leading to inconsistencies and administrative overhead.

These issues result in wasted time, potential content errors, and inefficient workflows, ultimately affecting the site’s performance and user experience.

This project proposal outlines a clear development and monetization roadmap, addressing a specific market need while highlighting the unique value proposition of MediaVersion Pro.




Below is an updated production-level architecture that integrates a Ruby on Rails API as a microservice to handle advanced media version control tasks for the WordPress plugin (MediaVersion Pro). In this design, the WordPress plugin (built in PHP) continues to manage the WordPress side—providing the user interface and initial media operations—while a separate Ruby on Rails application processes and stores detailed versioning data, handles complex business logic (e.g., cloud offloading and background processing), and exposes a secure RESTful API for communication.

---

## Overall Architecture Overview

- **WordPress Plugin (MediaVersion Pro):**  
  - Written in PHP; responsible for capturing media file events (uploads, updates, etc.), presenting an intuitive admin dashboard, and invoking API calls.
  - Contains core code, admin interfaces, public assets, and integration hooks.
- **Ruby on Rails API (MediaVersion Pro API):**  
  - A standalone Rails application that processes media versioning logic, stores detailed version histories in its database, and manages heavy tasks asynchronously.
  - Exposes RESTful API endpoints that the WordPress plugin uses to send and retrieve versioning data.
- **Communication Layer:**  
  - Secure REST API calls (using tokens or OAuth) between the WordPress plugin and the Rails microservice.
  - Optionally, asynchronous processing via webhooks and background jobs (e.g., using Sidekiq in Rails).

## Integration & Data Flow

1. **Event Capture (WordPress Plugin):**  
   When a media file is uploaded or updated, the plugin (in `class-mvp-media-manager.php`) captures the event.  
2. **Data Preparation & API Call:**  
   The plugin’s versioning class (`class-mvp-media-versioning.php`) prepares the file metadata and version information, then calls the Rails API using the wrapper in `class-mvp-rails-api.php`.  
3. **Rails API Processing:**  
   The Rails API (via the `MediaVersionsController`) receives the data, stores a new version record in its database (using the `MediaFile` model), and triggers any background jobs (via `ProcessMediaJob`) for heavy tasks (like compressing images or offloading to cloud storage).  
4. **Response & UI Update:**  
   The Rails API returns a JSON response, which the WordPress plugin processes to update the admin dashboard (e.g., showing version history).  
5. **Multisite Synchronization:**  
   For multisite environments, the plugin will send synchronization requests to the Rails API, ensuring that all sites in the network have consistent version data.

## Benefits of Integrating Ruby on Rails

- **Separation of Concerns:**  
  Offloading media versioning logic and background processing to a dedicated Rails API keeps the WordPress plugin lightweight and responsive.
- **Robust Background Processing:**  
  Ruby on Rails (with Sidekiq or similar) excels at handling asynchronous jobs, making it ideal for processing large media files or batch operations.
- **Scalable Storage and Performance:**  
  The Rails service can efficiently manage and store version histories, integrate with cloud storage providers, and scale independently of the WordPress site.
- **Enhanced API Flexibility:**  
  A well-designed RESTful API enables future integration with other platforms and mobile applications.

## Conclusion

By integrating a Ruby on Rails API into the MediaVersion Pro ecosystem, we can leverage the strengths of both PHP (for WordPress integration) and Rails (for heavy lifting and background processing). This combined architecture delivers a robust, scalable, and innovative solution for advanced media file version control that fills a critical gap in the WordPress ecosystem.

We invite you to review this integrated approach and consider how it can revolutionize media management for content-heavy websites.
